### Welcome to the Grimoire of Heart!
This folder is a work-in-progress space to welcome new players and help ease them into the Grimoire rule set. 

If you're new, make sure to grab the Core Rulebook first: [Download Here](https://github.com/grimoireofheart/grimoireofheart.github.io/raw/main/Resources/Grimoire%20of%20the%20Heart%20[Core%20Rulebook].pdf)
Make sure you're acclimated with these rules before delving into our extra content, known as the "Sea of Souls" supplements. 

The two PDFs in this folder are meant to explain in short terms the main features of each playable Class in the Grimoire, and the upsides and downsides of each Spell Type. These are meant to be surface-level and easily digestible, but we hope you'll find a Class and Types that click for your preferences and playstyle and find yourself comfortable diving into the more complex parts of the Grimoire. 

If you have any questions, you can reach the writers and knowledgeable Grimoire fans at our Discord: https://discord.com/invite/kDGnC4yqU6
