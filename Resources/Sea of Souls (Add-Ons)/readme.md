This is the Sea of Souls, a compilation of "official" add-ons for the Grimoire, written by the same authors as the core Grimoire and following the same design philosophies. 

This content was written and balanced to be on-par with the core Grimoire content, but can be more mechanically advanced than core content. Make sure your Narrator allows Sea of Souls content before using it. 

The "Volume X" PDFs are grouped versions of the stand-alone files, and are identical in content and interchangeable in use. Feel free to use whichever is more convenientt to you.
