This is the Sea of Souls, a compilation of "official" add-ons for the Grimoire, written by the same authors as the core Grimoire and following the same design philosophies. 

This content was written and balanced to be on-par with the core Grimoire content, but can be more mechanically advanced than core content. Make sure your Narrator allows Sea of Souls content before using it.
