# Update 4.6.2

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### General
* Typo and formatting fixes
* Changed Cling to Life's Categories to better match its effect (Revive, Interrupt, Defense (A))
* Internally updated title styles and placements. This will have minimum visual impact (such as Tier titles being centered as opposed to left-aligned). 
* Clarified the non-stacking nature of the Passive Intel Counter spells Perception, Powerful Perception, Absolute Perception and Eyes of Prometheus: The highest Tier spell now cancels the effect of all lower Tier spells. 
* Standardized the pdf name as "Grimoire of the Heart [Core Rulebook].pdf" to make updating and linking easier. 

### Sea of Souls 
* Expanded the explanation under Navis' Metaverse Pulse
* Added a "Last Updated" field to the Index page to help distinguish between versions
