Big news, Users: We're moving out! As a lot of people had problems accessing the Grimoire and navigating the folders, we'll be leaving OneDrive and moving all current and future Grimoire releases to a GitHub repository. This will help us deliver updates faster and keep track of issues and changes, and will help you access content in a fast, safe and efficient way. 

Our landing page for the Grimoire can be found at https://grimoireofheart.github.io, but you can find direct download links to all Grimoire content at https://github.com/grimoireofheart/GrimoireOfHeart
