### Core
* Combat: Added a clarification about Natural Skills.
	* Natural Skills are always considered Default Actions unless stated otherwise.

#### Spells
* Cognitive Blank: This spell had an upkeep cost too low for its powerful effect, specially for Navi Class Users
	* Time: ~~Free~~ **Quick**
	* Effect: [...] Spend 2 ~~counters~~ **Energy** to sustain this effect past the first turn as a Quick action. **This cost increases by 1 Energy every subsequent turn.**
* Despair: Time: ~~Default~~ **Quick**

### Sea of Souls Volume I
* Navi: Reworked the effects of Proud Aegis: 
	* Once per combat, ~~if the effect of a spell cast by a Navi causes an enemy’s attack to fail or deal 1 or less damage to any target,~~ **if a target would take damage from an attack of a certain Type while they’re under the effect of a spell cast by a Navi that reduces damage of that Type, or all Types,** the Navi User gains SP equal to half their character level.
