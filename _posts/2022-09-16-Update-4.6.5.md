# Update 4.6.5

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Typo and formatting fixes

PSA: A glitch in MS Word caused some lists in the Grimoire to stop rendering correctly. A few of these have been corrected but there might be more. If you catch any lists with blank squares for separators, do let us know. 

##### Spells
* Added a new Spell Category: Mono, for single-target spells, similar to Multi and Total
* God's Hand - Changed the "- 1 HDC" penalty to a "+1 HDC" bonus. It was noted that God's Hand was less consistent than its direct competitor, Heavenly Blade, while offering a minimal damage difference over it. This change makes God's Hand a more viable, less resource-intensive alternative to Heavenly Blade and the stronger Brave Blade. 
* Dance spells - Added new limitations to targeting. Dance spells now require spending Energy to hit targets more than once, and subsequent hits cannot benefit from Critical Hits or Weakness interactions. Along with this, the following spell was altered:
	* Flame Dance - Damage decreased from MAGd6+7 to MAGd6+6

##### Feats
* Charge (Feat) - Renamed to Demolition Dash. Expanded the explanation of the effect on non-Line spells.	

##### Bestiary
* Belial - Fixed an outdated reference to Negotiation
* Gucumatz - Expanded the explanation of the Natural Skill "Languages of the World"
	* Languages of the World now correctly grants a +1 Social Skill bonus to every social skill, during Shadow Negotiations only

### Sea of Souls, Volume II

##### Bestiary
* Added a new Shadow (Death Hel, Level 16)
* Added a new list of Shadows ordered by level to assist Narrators to organize their encounters
* Added missing interactions for Human Executioner (Resist Physical, Resist Thunder)

##### Marebito 
* Expanded the effect of "Berserk Release"
	* Berserk Release now counts as a Quick Action and can only be used by Marebito.
