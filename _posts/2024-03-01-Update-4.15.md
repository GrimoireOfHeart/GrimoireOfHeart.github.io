# Update 4.15

## Core 
* Hetelic Actions and Resistances: Changed the formatting and wording for easier understanding 

* Combat: Adjusted wording and formatting for Negotiation, placing them on a separate header for easier locating. 
* Additionally, added a new limitation to negotiating: If negotiation is rolled against a valid target, regardless of result, the User cannot attempt negotiation again this combat, even through the use of a spell or ability that forces negotiation to start. 
	* Some strategies allowed multi-Personae Classes to quickly "sweep" the board and acquire several Personae at once, giving them a massive increase in power and causing the User to accumulate too many resources to the detriment of the enjoyment of the rest of the party
	
* Minor formatting and spelling fixes 
	
## Português 
* As mudanças acima também foram replicadas na versão em Português
