# Update 4.7.5

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core - General
* Spell Categories: Added a new clause clarifying Repressed spells.
	* Page 69: Spending Energy equal to the Tier of a given spell allows you to cast it normally, **as long as you have uses of the spell that are not Repressed.**
	* Page 88: A Repressed spell’s use is removed from your deck after use. No effect can recover it unless it specifically denotes so. Repressed spells are restored normally during the daily spell reset. You can note Repressed spell uses using the “Repr” field on your Character Sheet. **If all uses of a spell are Repressed, you can no longer spend Energy to cast them**

##### Part VI - Activities 
* Revamped several outdated text blocks relating to activities and Confidants. The mechanics are still the same, but with clearer explanations. 
	* Pages affected: 60, 63, 64

### Sea of Souls Volume III
* Typo and formatting fixes
