# Sea of Souls, October Update

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Sea of Souls III
* Mirage Masters - A new Class has joined the Grimoire! 
	* This Class is centered around a new "Idolasphere Network" negotiation feature and powerful new Social Skill effects. 
	
### Sea of Souls II
* Celestial Mechanics - Damage adjusted from STRd4 to SKLd4 
	* As the basic Cover choice, this allows more characters to spec into Grimoires for cheap, and introduces a more streamlined progression: From Celestial Mechanic's SKL scaling, into either Margites -> Sanditon (STR) or Cardenio -> Fortunata (MAG), finally merging back into the Special Cover's SKL scaling.  
* Cardenio - Damage adjusted from SKLd6 to MAGd6
	* At SKLd6, Cardenio was a direct upgrade from Margites at the same price bracket, making Margites obsolete. Additionally, this splits Cover progression into two clear branches.
