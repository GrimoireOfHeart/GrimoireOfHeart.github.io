### Core
* Slightly modified Lucifer's stat block to specify that it cannot be obtained by Fusion, as Sea of Souls V introduces a side ruling for obtaining World Arcana Shadows
* Shadow Basic Attacks (Page 163) have received an universal buff to make them more viable across the board.
	* Damage has been increased from ~~SKLd4+Lv.~~ to **SKLd4+2Lv.**
	* Damage can now be Almighty *or* any Damage Type the Shadow possesses
	* This attack no longer rolls to hit

### Sea of Souls V
* Introduced "Icon Shadows", Personae belonging to major characters of the Persona series. These powerful new enemies must be defeated first before being obtained and carry unique, Type-fusing Natural Skills. 
	* This initial drop includes Shadows representing Revelations: Persona, Persona 2: Innocent Sin, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment, Persona 3, Persona 4, Persona 5 and Persona 5 Strikers, with more games to be represented in future updates. 
* Included special rules to fuse World Arcana Personae
