[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

## Core 
* Combat: Added an explanation of Conditions under "Status Effects and Conditions" 

* Strikes Twice: Effect reworked: 
	* Is now a Held Category spell
	* New effect: Spend 3 Energy and Repress this spell to cast. You gain the following Condition: Once per round, you can cast a Thunder spell from your deck as a Quick action. At the start of each of your turns under this effect, spend 3 Energy or remove this Condition. 
	* Strikes Twice was a relic of the original Grimoire release, and was made much more consistent and dangerous with additional content. This change aims to keep the motif and play style of ST builds while bringing it in-line with other character options

* Hetelic Resistances: Clarified rulings regarding Damage Gating and Combo spells

### Sea of Souls VII
* Added a new Tyrant: Soulless God Ougamatsu

* Added new Merciless Shadows: Beelzebub, Host of the Merciless Swarm and Merciless Delicacy - Dead Lobster
