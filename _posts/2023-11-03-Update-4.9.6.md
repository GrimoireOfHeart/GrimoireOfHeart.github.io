# Update 4.9.6

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Added a new "Affinity" category under Spell Categories, to streamline effects that improve or penalize the target's Type Interaction "steps"
	* This change in wording is reflected in Sea of Souls V and VI 

* Glossary: Added an explanation regarding our use of  Humans, Personae and Shadows as generic descriptors for "Player Character", "A player character's summon" and "Enemy"

### Sea of Souls VII
* Introducing Sea of Souls VII with Shadow Gear! These new pieces of gear can only be obtained by negotiating with Shadows and offer unusual and unprecedented new effects. 

* Added a new Shadow: Garm 

### Amala Terminal
* Updated "step" interactions to Affinity where relevant 

* Fixed missing navigation pane
