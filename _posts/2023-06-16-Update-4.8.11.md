# Update 4.8.11

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Added a limitation to negotiation: Negotiation cannot be initiated with targets whose Level is greater than your Character Level. 
* Typo and formatting fixes
* Loquacity: Time changed from Free to Quick
	* Loquacity allowed incredible flexibility, specially for Wildcards and Devil Summoners, so bringing its Time Category down one "step" was meant to balance it further
* Morning Star: Range clause reworked:
	* Any number of targets **within 3 meters** or a ~~10m~~ 5m radius explosion within ~~15~~ meters (this explosion ~~can hurt~~ **damages** allies within its range)
	* Morning Star's outdated range clause caused both confusion and a "power creep" over other spells and could trivialize some encounters. This revisit to the spell's range aims to make it more balanced when compared to spells of similar power, while keeping its destructive potential untouched
	
### Sea of Souls V
* Wormhole: Typo and formatting adjustment

### Sea of Souls VI
* Slightly expanded the Guardian of Kisaragi Ippon-Datara fight explanation to help with its combat Scene. 
* Added new Shadows:
	* L2 Bit Ball (Human/Machine), L2 Hooligan (Human)
	* L6 Killer Duck (Rumor), L7 Zombie Mouse (Rumor)
