### New Content
* Enter the Soul Hacker Handbook! This add-on introduces new COMP options for Devil Summoners, new gear inspired by Soul Hackers 2, new "Human"-class enemies and an optional rule for Sabbath attacks! This content is available in a commemorative standalone edition but its also been added to the base Sea of Souls books for convenience. 

### General
* Fixed Abbaddon's Types in the Fusion Reference Tables (From "Phys, Intel" to "Phys, Heal")

### Sea of Souls 
* Added new colored stat blocks to make Rumor Shadows (Violet Blue) and Humans (Light Purple) more visible from a glance
* Volume I: Added "Power of the Monoliths" as a feature for the Innocents. This is functionally identical to the Suppressors' Orgia Mode
