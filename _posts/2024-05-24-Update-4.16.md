## Core 
* Wildcards: Added a new Class Feature:
	* *All Is Revealed: The Wildcards’ special connection to their Personae allows them to tap into the immense power of Arcana Spreads. Unlike other classes, Wildcards can activate the Arcana Spread (Page 35) of any Active Persona, as if they were their Starters.* 
	* This change is meant to give Wildcards a small but significant distinction both from other Core classes and its Variants (Uninvited and Wild Qs), establishing a more concrete difference in playstyle between the three. 

* Bestiary: Throne image changed for a higher quality scan
	
* Minor formatting and spelling fixes 

## Português 
* As mudanças acima também foram replicadas na versão em Português 
* Ajustes: Especialização em Espadas (Feito), Amaterasu Hitoe (Armadura) e Vestes do Clérigo (Armadura) corrigidas para ficarem parelhas à versão em inglês. 


## Sea of Souls VIII
* Wild Q: Switching between Sub-Personae is now limited to once per Scene, or as a hard Default action during combat 
	* This is meant to both distinguish the Wild Q playstyle from other multi-users and to rein in their currently over-tuned defensive capabilities. Their Sub-Persona bonuses will not be affected at this time.
