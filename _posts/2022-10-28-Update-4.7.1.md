# Update 4.7.1

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Fixed several missing instances of Nuclear and PSY being counted amongst the regular "Elements", and of Light and Dark's functionalities
	* As Nuclear, PSY, and the new Light/Dark spells were introduced more recently, a few outdated mentions of Types listed Fire, Ice, Thunder and Wind but failed to mention Nuclear and PSY, and some passages still did not take into consideration the new Eiga and Kouga lines of spells.
* Combat: Fixed an outdated reference to Critical Hits 
* Fusion Reference: Fixed Futsunushi's interactions
	* Resists: Resist: Physical, Fire, Ice, Wind, Thunder, Light, Dark, **Nuclear, PSY**
	* Weak: Status, Intel, ~~Nuclear, PSY~~
* Velvet Room: Phrasing of Rituals adjusted to fully account for multi-Personae Users outside of Core (Devil Summoners, Mirage Masters, etc.)

### Sea of Souls III
* Mirage Masters: Revised several Idolasphere Network favors to be more internally balanced and appealing:
	* Goddess Statuette: You gain one extra Aspect Point ~~but it disappears at the end of the current Scene if it’s not used.~~ 
	* Shoes of the Wind: As combat starts, you can call upon this Contact to grant ~~any one ally you can see~~ **any number of units** an Initiative score bonus equal to ~~2~~ **1d10** + your highest Social Skill Tier.
	* Toothed Dagger: [...] This weapon is equipped to you immediately, replacing any weapon you have equipped. ~~At the end of combat, this weapon disappears.~~ **Only the User who activated this favor can equip this weapon, and it disappears at the end of the day.**
	* Aum Staff: [...] If you do, you are Revived with ~~10%~~ **30%** HP and penalties from entering Death’s Door ~~still apply~~ **do not apply**.
	* Blazing Emblem: This favor can be called upon during combat, and is considered an Interrupt action: Once an Arcana Spread is activated, you can call upon this Contact ~~and roll 1d12~~: ~~If the result is a 12,~~ that Spread’s use is restored at the end of combat. Outside of combat, that Spread’s use is restored at the start of the next Scene. ~~The Contact is spent regardless of the result.~~ **Each Arcana can only benefit from this favor once per session.**
* Bounties: Fixed the wording in a few spots of "Envoys of Beauty"
