[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Added a standardized Skill Check notation: Skill (Difficulty) (example: Magic (6) / Knowledge (2)) and expanded the explanation on Skill checks. 
* Added a text blurb pointing readers towards the new Bounty System for new downtime activities. 
* Expanded the Quick Start Guide and fixed its formatting 
	* Expanded the explanation on jobs and their required Skills, a change that is also mirrored in the Equipment section farther on
* Typo and formatting fixes

### Sea of Souls
* Enter the third volume of the Sea of Souls! Originally planned as the final update to Sea of Souls Volume II, the 'Book of Bounties' became large enough to headline its own add-on. 
	* Join the Board of Bounties and take on odd jobs, test your mettle in intense combat scenarios and uncover powerful new gear in our first batch of side quests! The Bounty Board introduces optional quests for characters between CLV. 1 and 12, with more to be added in the future.
