# Update 4.12

## Core 
* Added a quick reference to the HP field of targets with Hetelic Resistances to indicate their default Damage Gate values, and clarified the use of Damage Gating as a term in the description of Hetelic Resistances. 
	* This has been reflected in all current Sea of Souls Volumes. 
	
## Sea of Souls VI 
* Kisaragi: Clarified Hasumi's role in the final fight, and fixed a typo in her movement (page 29) 

## Sea of Souls VII 
* Fixed formatting issues caused by the Metaphor changes
