# Update 4.8.8

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Clarified the lack of an "Upper Aspect Point Cap"
	* Pages affected: Quick Start Guide and page 47
* Typo and Formatting fixes

### Sea of Souls III
* Clarified the Debuff Category of the following Earth Spells: 
	* Magna
* Slightly rewrote the description for the second Dueling effect of Magnadyne:
	* **Dueling**: Move your Duel target to an unoccupied position adjacent to you, and it cannot declare a movement action ~~for the duration of this effect~~ until the end of your next turn.

### Sea of Souls IV
* Added a missing lore block to Oldest Sibling, Mermaid-Alpha

### Sea of Souls V
* Eternal Black, Susano-o's Natural Skill, has received a slight rework:
	* As an Interrupt action, whenever you deal damage through the Curse of a spell you cast, you can spend 1 Aspect Point: Deal that same damage, as Dark damage, to ~~any number of ~~ **up to two other targets** within TEC meters, no dodge check.
	* Eternal Black was a very powerful tool that could ravage entire groups of enemies with a relatively low cost, so this rework brings it back in line with similar Interrupt-based strategies while keeping the offensive edge of an Icon NS
	
* Added a missing Spell Card for Psyche: Tempest (T3 Wind) 
* Added a new Icon Shadow: Hierophant Pascal (Level 16), from the original Shin Megami Tensei!
* Added four new Tyrants: Queen of Hearts, Merciful Clergyman, Kind Doctor, Best Friend, and Clockwork God, from Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth!
