### Core
* Removed a few outdated references to Charisma, as opposed to the current Charm

* Sentinel: Effect reworked: 
	* When an enemy within range of your equipped weapon declares an attack against one target other than you, you can spend your Interrupt action to declare a basic attack against that target: **This attack deals no damage, but** If you hit, the enemy's attack targets you instead.
