### Core
* Holy Arrow: Damage was adjusted to Gun Type (it was previously Physical) 
* Added a new standardized term for the resistances shared by Tyrants, Ultimate Personae and similar enemies as *Hetelic Resistances*. This change is reflected on Sea of Souls volumes 1 through 5. 

### Sea of Souls VI
* The sixth volume of Sea of Souls kicks off with a literal bang with the addition of 13 new Gun spells! Overwhelm your enemy with superior firepower and futuristic defensive measures with the new Warded condition and new STR-scaling spells for all Tiers.
