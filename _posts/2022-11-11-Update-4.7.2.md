# Update 4.7.2

[<< Home](https://grimoireofheart.github.io)

### Core
* Buff Spells: Users can no longer benefit from more than one Buff Type Spell at a time. For instance, if you are under the effects of Tarukaja and you cast Rakukaja on yourself, you must choose which of the two effects you'll keep. This does not apply to features that "Stack with Buff effects". Additionally, the following changes have been implemented:
	* Auto-Tarukaja, Auto-Rakukaja, Auto-Sukukaja: ~~Tier I~~ Tier II
	* Auto-Tarukajamon, Auto-Rakukajamon, Auto-Sukukajamon: ~~Tier II~~ Tier III
	* Auto-Tarukajaou, Auto-Rakukajaou, Auto-Sukukajaou: ~~Tier III~~ Tier V
	* Auto-Tarukajyne, Auto-Rakukajyne, Auto-Sukukajyne: ~~Tier V~~ No longer obtainable by Users.
	
* Mafrei: Damage adjusted from MAGd4 to MAGd4-5 to bring it in line with similar Tier I spells.
